Depending on the printer settings but also on the filament used, if the "in place" printed knucles can't be folded
here are two alternative solutions: 

- higher tolerance knuckles. Default is 0.15mm. The higher tolerance ones are 0.2mm and 0.25mm

- split knuckles. It's no longer "in place" printed, the parts assemble when you insert them into the fingers slots.
