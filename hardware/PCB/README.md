# PCB

This PCB was created using the online schema and pcb editors from https://easyeda.com/editor

It only uses standard parts easy to solder with a soldering iron (SMD capacitor c1 is not mandatory)

The gerber zip file can be used to order PCBs. I ordered mine from https://jlcpcb.com, where I could get 5 pieces for under $5 shipping included.
