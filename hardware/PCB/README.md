# PCB

There was a little bug on PCB v0.3, which is fixed in v0.4

If you already have or ordered version v0.3 let me know, it can be fixed with a little wire, and would only impact extension boards.


This PCB was created using the online schema and pcb editors from https://easyeda.com/editor

It only uses standard parts easy to solder with a soldering iron (SMD capacitor c1 is not mandatory)

The gerber zip file can be used to order PCBs. I ordered mine from https://jlcpcb.com, where I could get 5 pieces for under $5 shipping included.
