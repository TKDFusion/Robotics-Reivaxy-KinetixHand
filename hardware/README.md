If you think about building this device and having this PCB made, it would be wise waiting a couple more days for the next version
which does not have current monitoring but will be much easier to mount with a simple soldering iron (no SMDs).

And it will allow to add current monitoring later ! as well as testing other solutions, sensors, etc.
