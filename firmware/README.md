# Software

Folder rp2040 contains preliminary tests with an early prototype on breadboard.

Folder esp32 contains the actual software for the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3

Beware, it won't work with the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3 (C3 vs S3) because 5 analog inputs are needed for servo current monitoring.
